## 📌 Project Title

Give your project a simple, clear title (e.g., `Pretrained Image Classification Model with PyTorch`).

---

## 📄 Description

Briefly describe what the project does. Example:

> A Python project that loads and uses a pretrained deep learning model for image classification using PyTorch. This repository demonstrates how to load a pretrained model, preprocess images, and generate predictions.

---

## 🧠 Model

Explain:

* What pretrained model is used (e.g., ResNet50, BERT, etc.)
* Where it came from (e.g., torchvision, Hugging Face)
* What it is trained to do (e.g., classify images, predict sentiment)

Example:

> This project uses the ResNet50 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. It is capable of classifying images into 1,000 different object categories.

---

## 🚀 Installation

List dependencies and how to install them. For example:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow
```

---

## 📦 Usage

Provide a usage example. Show code snippets, input formats, or CLI examples:

```bash
python predict.py --image sample.jpg
```

Or in Python:

```python
from model import load_model, predict

model = load_model()
prediction = predict(model, "sample.jpg")
print(prediction)
```

---

## 📁 Files

Explain what each major file does:

* `model.py`: Loads and prepares the pretrained model.
* `predict.py`: Accepts image input and returns predictions.
* `utils.py`: Includes preprocessing and helper functions.

---

## 📷 Example

Show a sample input and output. If it's an image classifier, maybe:

> Input: 🖼️ `cat.jpg`
> Output: `"Tabby cat" (confidence: 92.3%)`

---

## ✅ Requirements

Mention:

* Python version
* Any libraries that need to be installed

---

## 🧪 Testing

If applicable, describe how to test the model or run evaluation.

---

## 📚 References

Mention:

* The pretrained model source (e.g., torchvision.models)
* Any papers or datasets used

---

## 📄 License

Specify a license if relevant (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
